# clean-eating  

A simple static site that (attempts) to get the food hygiene rating for the establishment you are in.  
Only works in the UK.
You will have to allow location every time you use it.
This is my first site, and first attempt at Javascript, so I know the code is horrible. 
Definitely needs a tidy-up at some point.
